# Paper MD Ingest

## Goal

Add research papers to an Obsidian-friendly `papers/` workspace as Markdown that agents and humans can read efficiently. Store stable paper materials under `papers/library/<paper-id>/`, project-specific reading maps under `papers/projects/`, and project-independent aggregation indexes under `papers/topics/`. Store `paper.md` as the primary full-text material and one reading-note `.md` file as the canonical Obsidian note for each paper. Do not store raw HTML, browser `_files/` folders, source archives, or PDFs unless explicitly requested.

This skill assumes Obsidian by default. Use wikilinks, aliases, embeds, backlinks, and lightweight frontmatter as first-class parts of the literature workflow.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target `papers/` workspace before ingesting. If it is missing or immature, read `references/workspace.md` and initialize missing basics such as `AGENTS.md`, `PAPERS.md`, `library/`, `projects/`, `topics/`, and an optional project map or topic index.
2. If the user gives paper ids, titles, or official URLs, resolve each paper directly.
3. If the user only gives a topic, project goal, or research direction, first ask concise follow-up questions until the scope is clear enough to search. If the user already provided a concrete goal, infer reasonable search axes and proceed.
4. For topic-based discovery, search arXiv first. Unless the user specifies a count, curate 5-10 papers. Prefer a balanced set that covers core benchmarks, infrastructure/framework papers, methodology/survey papers, and project-specific risks.
5. Convert the selected papers into a manifest with concise summaries in the user's working language before ingesting. Add project relevance only when the user explicitly supplies a project or the paper's project ownership is already clear from the request.
6. Prefer official arXiv HTML. Convert it to `paper.md` and retain figure images as remote Markdown links. If a legacy paper has no official HTML, a public HTML rendering mirror may supply figures, but the canonical note source remains the official arXiv/PDF URL.
7. If HTML is unavailable, use arXiv source and convert the TeX tree to `paper.md`.
8. If source is unavailable, extract text from the official PDF into `paper.md`.
9. Create or update one reading-note `.md` file under `library/<paper-id>/` in the user's working language as the canonical Obsidian note for the paper. `NOTES.md` is the default; a short title filename is allowed when it improves human navigation. When `paper.md` exposes usable HTML figures, select the one to three that explain the paper's mechanism, protocol, or main result and add them to the note with a concise reading cue; omit decorative or redundant figures.
10. Add a `source` field in the reading note frontmatter pointing to the best human-readable official source, usually arXiv HTML or official PDF.
11. Update `PAPERS.md` manually after batch generation.
12. Update `projects/<project>.md` only when the request explicitly identifies that active project or establishes unambiguous project ownership. A radar action alone does not establish project ownership. When no project is named, keep the canonical note project-neutral and use an existing topic index only when the grouping is genuinely long-lived.
13. If the paper belongs in a project-independent long-term grouping, create or update the relevant `topics/<topic>.md` index instead of inventing a project map.
14. Run `scripts/validate_papers_workspace.py` and fix every broken Markdown link, Obsidian wikilink/embed, missing heading target, missing `paper.md`, missing reading note, and missing `id/source` frontmatter field. For roadmap canvas edits, also validate that the `.canvas` file is parseable JSON and every edge references an existing node.

## Directory Shape

```text
papers/
  AGENTS.md
  PAPERS.md
  library/
    <paper-id>/
      <reading-note>.md
      paper.md
  projects/
    <project>.md
    <project> roadmap.canvas
  topics/
    <topic>.md
```

Use bare arXiv ids without version suffix for directory names, such as `library/2509.16779`. Use a stable slug for non-arXiv papers, such as `library/webaccessbench`. The default note filename is `NOTES.md`; a concise paper-title filename is also acceptable when it improves browsing. Whenever the note filename changes, update every project map and `PAPERS.md`, then run the validator.

For new or partially formed workspaces, use `references/workspace.md` as the initialization reference before ingesting papers.

## Obsidian Literature Workflow

Before creating or updating project maps, topic indexes, reading-note figures, or when unsure about wikilinks, embeds, aliases, heading links, frontmatter, or backlinks, read `references/obsidian.md`. Before converting HTML or choosing figures, read `references/conversion.md`.

Treat the non-`paper.md` reading note under `library/<paper-id>/` as the canonical Obsidian note for a paper. Treat `projects/<project>.md` as the human and agent reading entry for a project; treat `topics/<topic>.md` as a cross-project navigation index, not a second paper store or a project map.

### Project association gate

`## 与当前项目的关系` / `## Relationship to Current Project`, the manifest `relevance` field, and a project-map update are all optional. Add them only when the request names a project, or when an existing project map is the paper's clearly established owner. Do not infer a project from the paper's topic, tags, or a `knowledge-radar-actions` receipt. When the condition is absent, omit the section entirely; backlinks and a topic index already provide discovery without inventing a project relationship.

Use Obsidian Flavored Markdown in project maps:

```markdown
- [[papers/library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>|<short human title>]] - <one-line reason>![[papers/library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>#^summary]]
```

Use wikilink aliases for readable titles. Use inline block embeds for concise paper summaries directly on the same bullet as the paper link. In `主题聚合`, every paper bullet must include `![[...#^summary]]`; summary embeds are not optional there. Rely on backlinks so a paper note can reveal which projects, research questions, or decisions cite it. Prefer the stable summary block id `^summary` instead of embedding the whole summary heading section; the file path already identifies the paper, so paper-specific block ids are unnecessary. Do not copy `paper.md` or duplicate long single-paper analysis into project maps.

### Mermaid 流程图

当论文机制、实验协议或智能体生命周期需要流程图时，优先使用 `stateDiagram-v2` 描述多数以状态和事件迁移为主的场景，例如任务生命周期、执行状态、重试、通知与会话恢复。只有图的重点是静态拓扑、并行分叉或组件连接，而不是状态变化时，才使用 `flowchart`。

除 Mermaid 语法关键字及必须保留的代码、协议或专有标识外，图中的状态名称、迁移说明和注释必须使用用户的工作语言；中文笔记默认全部使用中文。

## Script

Use `scripts/ingest_papers.py` for deterministic fetching and conversion. Resolve the script from the installed or loaded `paper-md-ingest` skill directory; do not assume any fixed install root.

```bash
PY="${PY:-python3}"
PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR="<path-to-installed-paper-md-ingest>"
ROOT="papers"
"$PY" "$PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR/scripts/ingest_papers.py" --manifest batch.json --papers-root "$ROOT"
```

After every ingest, rename, or project-map edit, run:

```bash
PY="${PY:-python3}"
PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR="<path-to-installed-paper-md-ingest>"
ROOT="papers"
"$PY" "$PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR/scripts/validate_papers_workspace.py" --papers-root "$ROOT"
```

When a run adds or changes reading-note figures, also run the network-backed check:

```bash
"$PY" "$PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR/scripts/validate_papers_workspace.py" --papers-root "$ROOT" --check-remote-images
```

Manifest schema:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "2509.16779",
    "title": "Improving User Interface Generation Models from Designer Feedback",
    "authors": "Wu et al.",

      "limitations": "局限与边界：..."
    },
    "relevance": "可选：仅在请求明确指定项目时，写该论文与项目的关系。"
  }
]
```

For non-arXiv papers, set `source` to an official PDF URL and set `id` to a stable slug. `note_filename` is optional; omit it to use `NOTES.md`, or provide a concise safe filename when a short title improves browsing.

## Topic Discovery Requirements

When starting from a topic or project goal instead of known papers:

- Ask follow-up questions only when the goal is too broad, ambiguous, or missing the target domain.
- If the user has provided a concrete project goal, proceed with best-judgment arXiv search instead of blocking on questions.
- Default to 5-10 papers when the user does not specify a count.
- Record the search framing in the project map so future readers know why these papers were selected.
- Favor official arXiv ids and links. Use non-arXiv official PDFs only when a key source is not on arXiv.
- Do not treat arXiv search ranking as enough; curate for coverage across benchmark design, execution environment, evaluation fairness, reproducibility, transparency, and domain-specific benchmark examples.

## Reading Note Requirements

Each `library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>.md` note must have frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: <paper-id>
title: "<title>"
year: <year>
status: inbox|to-read|reading|key|done
source: "<official html/pdf/source url>"
tags:
  - <tag>
---
```

The body must use the user's working language, inferred from the request and manifest. Keep the section structure equivalent even when translating headings.

```markdown
## 三句话摘要

这篇论文解决的问题是：...
它使用的方法是：...
主要效果或发现是：... ^summary

## 论文定位

这篇论文属于什么方向？它在相关工作中解决哪一类问题？

## 问题背景

作者为什么认为这个问题重要？现有方法、benchmark、系统或评测协议哪里不够？

## 核心方法

论文提出了什么系统、数据集、benchmark、算法、checklist 或评估流程？

核心方法必须是扩展章节，而不是只写一段概括。开头先用 1-3 段概括整体方法、系统或评测流程；随后用 `###` 子标题拆解关键做法，让读者可以先扫总览，再按需深读机制细节。子标题应按论文实际贡献命名，例如 `### 任务实例 schema`、`### 执行式评测 pipeline`、`### 数据污染检测`、`### State-diff contract`、`### Scenario family 生成`。每个子标题下说明输入、处理步骤、输出/判分信号、隐藏信息或质量控制；如果论文涉及 contamination、cheating、资源预算、可复现环境、validator、judge 或 evaluator，这些机制必须在核心方法或紧邻方法章节中记录清楚，不要只放在实验/局限里一笔带过。

## 主要贡献

- ...
- ...
- ...

## 实验与结果

它怎么验证自己的方法？用了哪些 benchmark、baselines、metrics 或案例？结果说明了什么？

## 局限与边界

哪些场景没有覆盖？关键假设是什么？可能有什么偏差、风险或后续待验证点？

## 概念注释

在术语首次出现处用脚注补充理解正文所必需的概念，例如 `DeBERTa[^deberta]`。这里集中放置简短定义：

[^deberta]: **DeBERTa**：一种 encoder-only 预训练语言模型；继续说明它在本文方法中的具体职责。

```

`## 与当前项目的关系` 是可选章节。只有 manifest 提供非空 `relevance`，且该关系来自请求中指定的项目时才写入；没有项目上下文时不要留下空标题、`TODO` 或泛泛的关联判断。

Keep the three-sentence summary section short and stable. End the last summary line with the fixed block id `^summary` so project maps can embed only the summary content via `![[...#^summary]]`. Use the expanded sections for single-paper reading and future agent handoff. If the paper has not been deeply read yet, write a conservative initial note and mark uncertain details in the user's working language rather than overclaiming.

### Terminology Footnotes

Use Obsidian-compatible Markdown footnotes to explain specialized terms that a technically capable reader may still need in order to follow the paper. Add the marker at the term's first meaningful occurrence and collect definitions under `## 概念注释` / `## Terminology Notes` near the end of the reading note.

- Explain both **what the term means** and **what role it plays in this paper**; prefer one or two sentences over a dictionary-style definition.
- Prioritize model families, algorithms, datasets, evaluation protocols, file formats, losses, and paper-specific jargon that materially affect the method or experiment.
- Do not annotate common terms, repeat the same definition, or overload every paragraph with footnotes. The goal is to preserve reading flow while removing likely comprehension blockers.
- Use stable, descriptive lowercase ids such as `[^deberta]`, `[^cross-encoder]`, or `[^teacher-forcing]`. Ensure every marker has exactly one definition and every definition is referenced.
- Keep equations in Obsidian-compatible dollar delimiters. Footnotes remove terminology blockers; use the callout rules below for equations or mechanisms that require structured expansion.

Example:

```markdown
候选生成器使用 DeBERTa[^deberta] 对页面元素排序，再将 top-k 元素交给动作预测模型。

## 概念注释

[^deberta]: **DeBERTa**：微软提出的 encoder-only 预训练语言模型。本文将它用作高效元素排序器，而不是让它直接生成完整动作。
```

### Formula and Complex-Concept Callouts

Use an Obsidian-native `NOTE` callout immediately after a formula, special method, or complex concept when the explanation cannot fit in a one- or two-sentence terminology footnote. This requirement applies throughout the reading note, especially in `核心方法`, `实验与结果`, and any user-requested explanatory additions.

- Use `> [!NOTE] 公式解释` for a short explanation that should remain visible. Use `> [!NOTE]+ 公式解释` only when the block should be collapsible but initially expanded.
- Use `> [!NOTE]- 公式解释` for a content-heavy explanation that should be collapsed by default. Use equally literal titles such as `方法展开` or `概念展开` when the content is not an equation.
- Keep the surrounding paragraph understandable while the callout is collapsed: state the formula or method's basic purpose in the main narrative, then put the detailed unpacking in the callout.
- Explain a formula in plain language before enumerating symbols. Define every non-obvious parameter, variable, index, operator, normalization term, and constraint; state where each value comes from and whether it is fixed, observed, or learned when that distinction matters.
- Explain the overall relationship, not only the symbol table: identify the optimized or computed quantity, how the terms interact, which quantities increase or decrease together, and the trade-off, normalization, constraint, or stopping condition expressed by the equation.
- For a special method or concept, state its input or precondition, main transformation or decision steps, output or state change, and role in the paper's end-to-end method. Add a small example or boundary case when it clarifies a branch.
- Preserve the paper's notation and qualify any interpretation not stated by the source. A callout expands the local reading path; it does not justify inventing a derivation or replacing a dedicated note when the background is independently reusable.

Example:

```markdown
$$
\pi^*(y\mid x)=\frac{1}{Z(x)}\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}(y\mid x)
\exp\left(\frac{r(x,y)}{\beta}\right)
$$

> [!NOTE]- 公式解释
> 这是最大化“奖励减去 KL 惩罚”后得到的最优策略形式。它可以读成：先沿用参考策略对输出 $y$ 的偏好，再按奖励做指数加权，最后归一化为概率分布。
>
> - $x$ 是输入，$y$ 是候选输出；$\pi^*(y\mid x)$ 是优化后的策略概率。
> - $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}(y\mid x)$ 是固定的参考策略，$r(x,y)$ 是输出获得的奖励。
> - KL 惩罚衡量整个策略分布偏离参考策略的程度；在这个闭式解中，它通过 $\pi_{\mathrm{ref}}$ 与 $\beta$ 共同体现。
> - $\beta>0$ 控制偏离参考策略的成本；$\beta$ 越大，奖励带来的重加权越弱，策略越接近参考策略。
> - $Z(x)$ 是对所有候选输出求和得到的归一化项，保证最终概率之和为 1。
> - 整体关系是：奖励越高的输出概率会指数上升，但参考策略和 $\beta$ 共同限制策略偏移的幅度。
```

### Core Method: blocking completeness requirement

`## 核心方法` / `## Core Method` is the main handoff surface. A one-sentence description, a list of component names, or a restatement of the abstract is incomplete and must not be handed off as a reading note.

Read the paper's method sections in `paper.md` before drafting this section. Start with one short end-to-end overview, then use `###` subheadings to make the mechanism executable in the reader's head. Each relevant subheading must state the concrete input or state, transformation steps, output or state change, and the signal that controls, validates, or terminates the step. Preserve original notation, equations, schemas, action names, and thresholds when they carry the mechanism; explain them in the user's working language instead of replacing them with generic prose.

Cover the applicable items below. Omit only items the paper truly does not define, and say what remains unspecified when that absence matters:

- **System / agent**: components, their visible state, data and control flow, tool or action semantics, memory writes, feedback loop, termination, and error or rollback path.
- **Algorithm / training method**: objective or reward, inputs and outputs, each iteration or decision step, learned versus fixed parts, and inference-time behavior.
- **Benchmark / dataset**: task contract, instance schema, source data, construction pipeline, splits, human or automatic validation, evaluator, metrics, hidden information, and contamination or leakage controls.
- **Cost / resource method**: budget definition, accounting units, expansion or stopping rule, and what qualifies as a successful low-cost run.

For complex methods, include a numbered lifecycle, a compact formula or schema when the paper gives one, and a small running example or failure case when it clarifies a branch. Apply the formula-callout requirement whenever the equation carries part of the method: reproducing the equation without explaining its parameters and overall relationship is incomplete. Place benchmark-specific validation and evaluator details in this section or directly beside it, not only under results or limitations. Before handoff, check that a reader can answer: “what enters the method, what changes at each step, why it advances or stops, and what artifact is judged?”

### Key Figure Requirements

Use `## 关键图示` / `## Key Figures` when the paper's public HTML exposes a figure that materially improves understanding. Insert the section after `核心方法` and before contributions. Each selected figure must use a direct, public `https://` image URL from the paper's official HTML or a clearly identified public HTML rendering mirror; never use `data:` URLs, local files, screenshots, logos, UI decoration, or unverified search thumbnails. Verify that the URL returns an image before writing it. Keep the original figure number or caption in a short sentence, then add one Chinese/working-language sentence explaining what to inspect. A paper may have no suitable figure; do not add a placeholder or force an image merely for visual variety.

For manifest-driven generation, pass selected figures through the optional `figures` list. `ingest_papers.py` writes them into the canonical note, but does not choose their semantic relevance: inspect `paper.md` and its captions first. The usual target is one figure; use two or three only when they explain distinct necessary mechanisms.

## Project Map Requirements

When a batch is tied to a project, create or update `projects/<project>.md`. Project maps are the primary human/agent reading entry for project-specific literature. They should explain why the papers matter to the project, not duplicate single-paper notes.

Use Obsidian double links to the canonical notes:

```markdown
- [[papers/library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>|<short human title>]] - <one-line reason>![[papers/library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>#^summary]]
```

Use the fixed `^summary` block id from the reading note. Keep the paper title, one-line reason, and embedded summary on the same bullet. See `references/obsidian.md` for Obsidian wikilink and embed syntax.

Required content:

- A project title and short project goal.
- A paired roadmap canvas embedded near the top of the project map.
- A `主题聚合` section with project-specific groupings by problem, module, decision, or reading stage; every paper listed there must include an inline `![[...#^summary]]` block embed on the same bullet.
- A `推荐阅读路径` section after `主题聚合`, with ordered double links and one-line reasons.
- Obsidian double links to every referenced paper note.

Strongly recommended content:

- Lightweight frontmatter with `type: note`, `status`, `visibility`, and `literature-map` tags.
- A search framing section when papers were discovered from a topic or project goal.
- A `阅读关注点` section only when useful, for what to inspect during close reading, open questions, or follow-up paper gaps. Do not add a generic `设计笔记` section by default.

Do not duplicate `paper.md` or reading notes in project folders. Keep long single-paper analysis in `library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>.md`; keep project maps focused on navigation, synthesis, and project relevance.

## Topic Index Requirements

Use `papers/topics/<topic>.md` when the requested grouping is long-lived and independent of a specific project, such as classics, a method family, or a benchmark category. Do not create a project map merely to hold that grouping.

- Add lightweight frontmatter with `type: topic-index`, `status`, `visibility`, and topic tags.
- Link only to canonical reading notes in `library/`; use `![[...#^summary]]` for compact recall when helpful.
- Organize entries by conceptual dependency or reading order, and state why they belong in the same index.
- Do not create a roadmap canvas, duplicate paper note, or topic-specific raw-material directory.

## Project Roadmap Canvas

Each project map should have a paired roadmap canvas named `papers/projects/<project> roadmap.canvas`. Embed it near the top of the project map, usually after the project goal and before search framing:

```markdown
## Roadmap

![[papers/projects/<project> roadmap.canvas]]
```

Use a roadmap.sh-inspired layout for project roadmaps:

- Put project themes on the vertical center spine. These orange nodes should mirror the `主题聚合` subsections, such as problem areas, platform modules, design decisions, or reading stages. Do not make individual papers the main spine unless the project has only one linear reading list and no meaningful themes.
- Put concrete papers as blue branch nodes under the theme they support. Each paper node should use a vault-relative wikilink to the canonical reading note, with a short alias.
- Add a third-level explanation node for every paper node. The explanation node should state the paper's project role in one sentence, usually reusing the one-line reason from `主题聚合`.
- Use orange main nodes, preferably `#f6a800`; blue branch nodes, preferably `#b9dcff`; and blue branch lines such as `#2f7de1`. Keep top context blocks such as project goal or usage notes in neutral white nodes.
- Use pale blue `#eaf4ff` for third-level explanation nodes. Connect each paper node to its explanation node with a gray line such as `#9ca3af`, set `toEnd: "none"`, and align the two node centers vertically so the edge is horizontal and does not cross other edges.
- Preserve the project-map meaning: theme nodes answer "what design question or module is this cluster about?", and paper branches answer "which paper supplies evidence, patterns, or risks for this theme?"
- Make node widths large enough for the displayed title. Use at least 260-320px for theme nodes and widen paper nodes for Chinese or mixed Chinese/English aliases. If text does not fit, widen the node or split a long branch into multiple concise paper nodes.
- Keep all paths vault-relative. Do not use absolute paths inside `.canvas` or project maps.

## PAPERS.md Requirements

Keep `PAPERS.md` as a lightweight global inventory and audit list, not the primary reading interface. Project-specific reading belongs in `projects/<project>.md`, and cross-project curated paths belong in `topics/<topic>.md`; `PAPERS.md` exists for de-duplication, quick whole-library scanning, and checking that every library item is indexed. Each entry should include:

```markdown
- [<paper-id> <title>](library/<paper-id>/<reading-note>.md)
  - Tags: `<tag>`, `<tag>`
  - Summary: <two or three concise sentences in the user's working language>
  - Source: <official source URL>
```

Prefer concise entries in `PAPERS.md`. Put richer reading paths, rationale, and synthesis in project maps.

Do not create `papers.jsonl` unless the user explicitly asks for a later indexing phase.

## Validation Requirements

Run the validator after every ingest, note rename, `PAPERS.md` edit, or project-map edit:

```bash
PY="${PY:-python3}"
PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR="<path-to-installed-paper-md-ingest>"
ROOT="papers"
"$PY" "$PAPER_MD_INGEST_DIR/scripts/validate_papers_workspace.py" --papers-root "$ROOT"
```

The validator must pass before handing off. It checks library structure, reading-note frontmatter, `PAPERS.md` inventory coverage, Markdown links, Obsidian wikilinks/embeds, and embedded heading targets. `--check-remote-images` additionally fetches selected figures and requires `image/*`; use it whenever figures change.

For roadmap canvas edits, also validate JSON parseability and edge integrity. At minimum, parse the `.canvas` file and check that every `fromNode` and `toNode` exists in `nodes`. When the canvas has third-level explanation nodes, verify their explanation edges are gray, use `toEnd: "none"`, and have matching vertical centers with their second-level paper nodes.
